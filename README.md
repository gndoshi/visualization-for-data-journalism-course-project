# Using Plotly For Visualization: Final Project for Course

### Important Note: For this project, I have used Plotly. Thus, since GitHub doesn't directly render the plots in the notebooks, I have provided 13 Final Plots as additional attachments in this repository. Also, to go through my storytelling process and how I explored the data to finally create the 'final plots', please visit the following link to view a nice rendered version of this notebook which includes all the plots including the ones where I chose to experiment. Here is the link: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/gndoshi/visualization-for-data-journalism-course-project/blob/master/utf-8%27%27final_assignment%20%281%29.ipynb


This was the final project for the Visualization for Data Journalism course offered by the University of Illinois on Coursera. 

Dataset â€” Airline Delay Causes. This data set consists of on-time statistics for airlines in the United States. This data set is freely available from The US Department of Transportation: http://www.transtats.bts.gov/OT_Delay/OT_DelayCause1.asp.

The Data and column labels are explained in the "Project Brief_Using_plotly_for_data_visualization" PDF document. 

For the purpose of this assignment - data set of entries from February 2009 to February 2019 was downloaded and used.

Delays can be categorized into:

- Air carrier, where the cause was within the airline's control (e.g., maintenance or crew problems, aircraft cleaning, baggage loading, fueling, etc.).
- Extreme weather such as tornadoes, blizzards, or hurricanes.
- National Aviation System (NAS), which refers to a broad set of conditions, such as non-extreme weather conditions, airport operations, heavy traffic volume, and air traffic control.
- Late-arriving aircraft, where a previous flight with same aircraft arrived late, causing the present flight to depart late.
- Security, caused by evacuation of a terminal or concourse, re-boarding of aircraft because of a security breach, inoperative screening equipment, and/or long lines in excess of 29 minutes at screening areas.

This was an open-ended assignment which required students (me) to explore and program on my own. In the images provided, you can see that I visualized the data, based on some guidance questions which were:

- On which airline should you fly to avoid significant delays?
- In which months should you fly to avoid significant delays?
- Are there any relationships between seasons and flight delays?
- Which region of airport has the most significant number of delays?
- What are the major reasons for the delays?

As you can see from the final images provided, I utilised bar graphs, maps, pie charts, scatter plots, etc. to visualize the data and come to some comprehensive answers to the above questions.
